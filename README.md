# SocialMesh

SocialMesh is a community fork of [Shoutrrr](https://github.com/coollabsio/shoutrrr), an open-source, self-hosted social media publishing and scheduling app. This repository keeps the upstream code and history while applying SocialMesh branding.

**An open-source, self-hostable alternative to Buffer, Typefully & Hootsuite.**

Write once, publish everywhere. Schedule posts to X, Bluesky, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and Discord from one calendar — on your own server, with your own data.

## What is SocialMesh?

SocialMesh is a social media scheduling tool you run yourself. Connect your accounts, draft a post once, and send it to every network at the same time — or queue it to go out on a recurring schedule. No monthly seat fees, no third party holding your tokens or your data.

It's built for individuals and teams: invite collaborators into a shared workspace, keep clients or brands separated, and see how your posts perform — all from a single, fast interface.

## Why SocialMesh?

- **You own everything** — your posts, your audience tokens, your analytics. Self-hosted on your infrastructure.
- **One post, every platform** — compose once and publish to multiple accounts, tweaking the text per network when you want.
- **Plan ahead** — a posting queue with recurring time slots and a month calendar, so your feed stays consistent without you babysitting it.
- **Made for teams** — workspaces, roles, and email invites keep clients and collaborators tidy.
- **No vendor lock-in** — open source under the Apache 2.0 license, runs anywhere Docker does.

## Features

- 📝 **Composer** — draft with media and alt text, see live per-account text and video limits (including detected X subscription limits), and automatically split long posts into threads where the platform supports it.
- 🚀 **Multi-account publishing** — fan one post out to many accounts at once, with optional per-platform overrides. Each target publishes independently and retries on failure.
- 🗓️ **Queue & calendar** — set recurring posting slots (in your workspace's timezone), drop drafts into the queue, and review everything on a month calendar. Publish instantly whenever you like.
- 📊 **Analytics** — follower and post-count trends per account, plus per-post engagement (likes, reposts, replies, impressions) where the provider API supports it.
- 🔗 **Connected accounts** — link accounts via OAuth (X, LinkedIn) or app password (Bluesky), group them into reusable sets, and get nudged when one needs reconnecting. Tokens are stored encrypted and refreshed automatically; a successful authenticated X tier refresh also restores a stale attention state.
- 👥 **Workspaces & team** — multiple workspaces with role-based memberships, email invitations, and ownership transfer. Every bit of data is scoped to its workspace.
- 🔔 **Notifications** — in-app alerts when a post publishes or fails, or when an account needs attention.
- 🔐 **Secure by default** — email/password with verification, two-factor (TOTP), passkeys (WebAuthn), and optional social login (Google, X, LinkedIn).

## Self-hosting

SocialMesh publishes its own multi-architecture image to GHCR. For an Oracle VPS deployment, follow the [SocialMesh production deployment guide](docs/SOCIALMESH_PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md). The production Compose stack pulls `ghcr.io/revanthlol/socialmesh` and uses Caddy for automatic HTTPS; it does not build the source on the server.

For local development with source mounts and Vite HMR, use `docker-compose.dev.yml` and the development instructions in the repository. Do not use the upstream Shoutrrr image or the production stack for frontend development.

### Security headers & Content-Security-Policy

Outside `local`, SocialMesh sends a strict, nonce-based **Content-Security-Policy** along with `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, and (in production) `Strict-Transport-Security`. This is deliberate hardening — but if you customise the frontend or front the app with an unusual proxy/CDN, it's the first place to look when something renders wrong.

**If the UI loads unstyled or a feature is broken, open your browser's dev console and check for CSP violations.** Common causes and fixes (all in `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php`):

- **Assets served from a different origin than `APP_URL`** (e.g. a CDN host) are blocked by `default-src 'self'`. Serve built assets from the app origin, or add the host to `script-src`/`style-src`/`img-src`.
- **Third-party embeds or analytics scripts** are blocked — `script-src` only trusts the app's own nonced scripts (`'strict-dynamic'`). Add the source explicitly if you need it.
- **Images/avatars from arbitrary hosts** are allowed (`img-src` permits `https:`); tighten this if you prefer.

The CSP is intentionally **not** sent in `local` (`APP_ENV=local`) because it is incompatible with the Vite dev server's hot-reload. To verify the production policy locally, run a build and serve with a non-local env (`bun run build && APP_ENV=production php artisan serve`). Note that `Strict-Transport-Security` requires the app to be served over HTTPS.

## Connecting your accounts

**Bluesky** connects two ways, and neither needs you to register a developer app:

- **OAuth (recommended)** — users sign in on Bluesky and authorize SocialMesh without handing over a password. It's zero-config: SocialMesh publishes an [ATProto OAuth](https://atproto.com/specs/oauth) client-metadata document at `${APP_URL}/oauth/bluesky/client-metadata.json` (with keys at `${APP_URL}/oauth/bluesky/jwks.json`), and Bluesky's authorization server fetches those to identify your instance. The signing key is generated once and stored encrypted — there's nothing to add to `.env`. **The one requirement:** `APP_URL` must be a public HTTPS URL, because Bluesky has to reach those two documents over the internet. (In `local` dev, SocialMesh falls back to a loopback client so OAuth still works on `localhost`.)
- **App password** — users paste a Bluesky [app password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords). No setup, and it works anywhere — including private or LAN deployments Bluesky can't reach for OAuth.

**X**, **LinkedIn**, and the **Meta** platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Threads) publish through your own developer app, so you'll register one with each provider and add the credentials to `.env`. The redirect URIs must match what you register (they default to `${APP_URL}/...`):

```dotenv
# X — https://developer.x.com
X_CLIENT_ID=
X_CLIENT_SECRET=
X_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/x"

# LinkedIn — https://www.linkedin.com/developers
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=
LINKEDIN_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/linkedin"

# Facebook + Instagram — one Meta app (https://developers.facebook.com).
# Instagram accounts are discovered via their linked Facebook Pages, so both
# platforms share these credentials. Publishing to non-test accounts requires
# Meta App Review + Business Verification.
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID=
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET=
FACEBOOK_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/meta"

# Threads — a separate Meta app (https://developers.facebook.com).
THREADS_CLIENT_ID=
THREADS_CLIENT_SECRET=
THREADS_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/accounts/callback/threads"
```

Optionally, let people sign in with a social account instead of a password:

```dotenv
SOCIALITE_ENABLED=true
SOCIALITE_PROVIDERS=google            # comma-separated: google,x,linkedin
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="${APP_URL}/auth/google/callback"
```

> **Heads up:** publishing, scheduling, engagement polling, and analytics capture rely on a running queue worker and scheduler. The provided Docker setups start both for you. Metrics and engagement are enabled by default and can be disabled with `METRICS_ENABLED=false` / `ENGAGEMENT_ENABLED=false` (see `config/metrics.php` and `config/engagement.php`). X accounts read the authenticated account's subscription type when connected or when **Refresh tier** is used in Connected Accounts; Free accounts use a 280-character / 140-second-video limit, while Basic, Premium, and Premium+ accounts use 25,000 characters and can upload videos up to four hours. When a post targets more than one X account, the composer enforces the strictest selected account limit.

## Development

SocialMesh is a Laravel 13 (PHP 8.5) app with a React 19 + TypeScript frontend on [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) v3, [Tailwind v4](https://tailwindcss.com), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com). It runs on [Laravel Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/octane) (FrankenPHP), with typed routes generated by [Wayfinder](https://github.com/laravel/wayfinder).

```bash
composer setup   # install deps, copy .env, generate app + Passport keys, bun install, build assets
composer dev     # serve + queue + scheduler + logs + Vite, all at once
```

> Uses [Bun](https://bun.sh) for the frontend (`bun install`, `bun run …`) — not npm/pnpm.

To test SMTP locally during development, run [Mailpit](https://github.com/axllent/mailpit):

```bash
docker run --rm --name mail --pull always -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 axllent/mailpit:latest
```

Then set these mail values in your `.env` file:

```dotenv
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_SCHEME=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="hello@shoutrrr.local"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

### How publishing works

A post is composed once, then split into one **target** per connected account. The scheduler dispatches due posts every minute; a queued `PublishPostTarget` job then publishes each target independently, with retries, idempotency, and a per-attempt audit trail. Scheduled jobs refresh OAuth tokens before they expire, fetch replies, and check for due metrics captures every 15 minutes. Metrics refresh cadence is controlled in `config/metrics.php`.

### API & MCP tokens

The REST API and MCP integration authenticate with bearer tokens minted by [Laravel Passport](https://laravel.com/docs/passport), which signs and verifies every token with an RSA keypair. **You don't need to provision these keys** — the first time a workspace issues an API key, SocialMesh generates the pair automatically (`ApiKeyManager::ensureEncryptionKeysExist()` runs `passport:keys`) and stores it in `storage/oauth-private.key` / `oauth-public.key`. The bundled Docker setups persist `storage` on a named volume, so the keys survive redeploys.

If you'd rather provision them explicitly — for example to share one keypair across multiple app instances behind a load balancer — do either of the following before issuing keys:

- Run `php artisan passport:keys` once and keep `storage` persistent, **or**
- Set the `PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `PASSPORT_PUBLIC_KEY` env vars to the key contents (the auto-generation step is skipped when both are present).

To turn auto-generation off entirely, set `PASSPORT_AUTO_GENERATE_KEYS=false`. Issuing an API key without keys present then fails loudly instead of writing new ones — useful when the keypair is managed externally and SocialMesh must never mint its own.
